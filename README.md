# Data Visualization and Reporting Tool

This project provides a web interface for uploading, visualizing, and generating reports from CSV data. It utilizes Django for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and integrates with a cloud platform (like Google Cloud) for potential scalability and storage.

## Features

* **Data Upload:**  Upload CSV files for analysis.
* **Data Visualization:** Display data in an interactive table format with pagination and search functionality.
* **Report Generation:** Generate comprehensive reports based on the uploaded data.  This feature includes a loading indicator to enhance user experience during report processing.
* **Data Comparison:** Compare different datasets (implementation details not shown in provided code snippet but implied by the UI).
* **Search and Filtering:**  Search data across all columns or within a specific column.
* **Pagination:**  Browse large datasets efficiently with pagination.


## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud (potential, based on project structure and context) -  consider services like Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and App Engine.
* **Database:**  (Not specified but likely used with Django) - PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.
* **Other Libraries:**  Pandas (implied for data manipulation)


## Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd <project_directory>`
3. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Set up database:**  Create a database instance and configure the database settings in the Django `settings.py` file.
5. **Run migrations:** `python manage.py migrate`
6. **Start the development server:** `python manage.py runserver`

## Cloud Deployment (Example: Google Cloud)

While the specific cloud deployment setup isn't included in the provided code, here's a general outline for deploying to Google Cloud (adapt as needed for other platforms):

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project:** Set up a project in the Google Cloud Console.
2. **Choose a Deployment Option:**  App Engine, Kubernetes Engine, or Compute Engine. App Engine is often a good choice for web applications.
3. **Configure Deployment Settings:** Follow the platform-specific deployment instructions (e.g., using the `gcloud` CLI for App Engine).
4. **Set up Cloud Storage:** Configure Cloud Storage to store uploaded CSV files if necessary.
5. **Configure Cloud SQL:**  Set up a Cloud SQL instance if using a relational database.
6. **Deploy the application:** Deploy the Django project to your chosen platform.

## Future Enhancements

* **Enhanced Report Generation:** Add more sophisticated reporting features, such as customizable reports, charts, and graphs.
* **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization to control access to data.
* **Improved Data Visualization:**  Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) for more visually appealing data representation.
* **Data Validation:** Implement robust data validation during upload to ensure data integrity.
